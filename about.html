      <h1 class="about-title">We didn’t open a coffeshop. We started a ritual.</h1>
      <p class="about-text">
        Morning Ritual was born from a shared obsession with the perfect pour, the subtle complexity of a natural Ethiopian,
        and the quiet magic of a well-crafted croissant. Somewhere between golden-hour playlists, ceramic cups made by local
        artists, and beans we can’t shut up about, our space became more than a coffee shop—it became a pause button for modern life.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        Our team? A mix of ex-baristas, design nerds, home-roasters and plant parents, all united by an unreasonable amount of
        love for coffee culture and community vibes. We source ethically, we steam with intention, and yes, we will recommend
        a book with your cappuccino if you give us half a chance.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        You’ll find us where the espresso is golden, the playlists are moody, and no one asks if you’ve had your coffee yet—
        because of course you have.
